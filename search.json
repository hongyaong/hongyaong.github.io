However, for Usage Frequency values &lt; 10, the counts is slightly lower.\nThe statistic summary of Usage Frequency shows that the dataset mean Usage Frequency is 15.81 and it’s ranging from 1 to 30 Usage Frequency.\n\n\n\n\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.

Support calls of 5 onward has a stable frequency of around 20000.\nThe statistic summary of Support Calls shows that the dataset mean Support Calls is 3.604 and it’s ranging from 0 to 10 calls."
